				Small Challenge: Pick the items in the buildings.
				<br>
				Step in any direction you like, there is no special order: every platform and object is clickable in a certain way. Find the items (which are four) and they will disappear.
				</p>
				<p>
				Supports teleporting. So, lean back and dive in.

					<h4>Notes</h4>
					<p>
					Working with Magica Voxel objects requires export as <span class="highlight-red">.glb</span> or <span class="highlight-red">.obj and .mtl</span>. Used here is the latter method. They had to be refined in Blender: first, remesh the object and decimate as much polygons/triangles as possible.
					</p>
					<p>
					Then, bake the texture of the original on a duplicate of the object. Make sure to save the palette.png in the same folder. Helpful video on YouTube: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhJWib1t5Fg">MagicaVoxel - Optimizing and exporting of 3D voxel models</a>.
					</p>
					<p>
					In the <strong class="highlight-red">Rainy Voxel World</strong> I rotated the objects in non-right y-angles which makes them look a bit jagged and pixelated. But I'm OK with that appearance.
